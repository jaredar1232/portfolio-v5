# Personal Portfolio

##

This is version 5 of my portfolio

- Version 1: Single scrollable page built from create react app
- Version 2: Single page app, with multiple "pages", still built on create react app
- Version 3: Overhauled to Gatsby
  • ChatGPT API integrated with a Vercel server I set up to manage the API between the two
- Verson 4: Overhauled to Next.js
  • Hosted on Vercel, so server managing chat ai api was migrated into this project
  • Contact form managed with speedform now
- Version 5: Overhaul from Styled Components to Tailwind. Styled Components had runtime and injection costs
